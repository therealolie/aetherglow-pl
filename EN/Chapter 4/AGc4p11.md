Using the neural interface, you run your organic visual feed through a program filtering out all colors except a narrow range, then feed it back into your perception. Keeping a flexible control over that variable, you realize you can intuitively adjust your color focus now.  A whole new sense has opened up to your mind.

`2254-06-01 16:10:40 Aydan > I applied a color filter to my actual vision! I never thought of using the interface this way!`

`2254-06-01 16:10:52 明子 > there's all kinds of stuff you can do with that. obfuscation school technopaths like to use that kind of thing on other people to make them perceive illusions`

`2254-06-01 16:11:04 Aydan > what specialty path are you on?`

`2254-06-01 16:11:12 明子 > me? Communication school, under Professor Reina's guidance!`

`2254-06-01 16:11:20 Aydan > I wonder which one I'll choose next year...`

`2254-06-01 16:11:26 Aydan > actually I don't know why I bother thinking of it, my family will probably expect me to pursue the Administration school`

`2254-06-01 16:11:31 明子 > I didn't take you for the private tuition type`

`2254-06-01 16:11:40 Aydan > I suppose you're military`

`2254-06-01 16:11:47 明子 > like most kids here`

`2254-06-01 16:12:00 Aydan > actually it's both ways for me. my family are board members for Redshift Security, it was decided I would be a ranking officer in the Redshift forces before I was born`

`2254-06-01 16:12:12 明子 > how opposite, yet not too different an outcome. there’s nothing for me back on 当たら千葉, and signing on to DeepSpaceOps was my only way out of a bleak future`

You stop suddenly.

`2254-06-01 16:12:18 Aydan > DSO! oh, I guess technically we are at war...`

Akiko stops and leans back against a large boulder in the middle of the flower garden, in the shade from the emerging sun.

`2254-06-01 16:12:25 明子 > Asteroid Ida, yes. contracted by two rival mining companies...but that's a long way from here, and that will be over by the time I graduate next year, I hope`

`2254-06-01 16:12:38 Aydan > I hadn't given it much thought...everyone I meet here could someday be someone I meet in battle...`
