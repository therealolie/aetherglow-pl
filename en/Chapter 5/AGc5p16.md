“Yeah, we should make sure it’s okay,” you sign. You stand up almost simultaneously to follow after Zeta.

You sign, “I keep feeling like--“

“--We’re thinking the same thoughts,” signs Akiko.

“It’s disorienting.”

“Yeah. I haven’t gotten used to it. But they say it gets easier.”

“Have you done this with a lot of people?” you sign.

“A few, in class. I think the year 2 mid-term is going to be a sync test, so this was helpful practice actually. But the lasting effects aren’t anywhere near this heavy when it’s not someone you really know at all,” she signs.

“That’s good, it would be awkward to go through with any technopath I ever sync with,” you sign.

Out in the forest path, you two are alone, no sign of Zeta.

“It sure disappeared in a hurry,” she signs.

“Zeta’s good at hiding. I could probably guess a few places it would go,” you sign.

You find your way out of nature, back to the path bridging the two districts of the colony. You point toward the academic block. Akiko takes your hand again and follows you.

Sun sets once more as you cross the cylinder’s edge, and by the time you reach the cluster of buildings, you walk back into its light, with its wavering glare sliding across the aluminum courtyard, magnified through the watery firmament above you. You pass by a few other students. Not too many are out here on this off day morning.

You reach the corner of the academic block, the edge of the Admin building, only to see Zeta fly over your heads, jumping from the roof over the glass to the nearby corner of the residential block.

A message arrives.

`2254-06-04 10:40:11 Zeta > ALONE`

`[Zeta disliked that]`

“You get that too?” Akiko signs.

You nod in affirmation. “We should respect its wishes,” you sign.

“Then let’s go the opposite direction,” she signs.

“I guess...want to find something else to do together?” you sign.

“Yeah...I think I’d be really lonely otherwise,” she signs.

“Yeah, I don’t want to be alone either,” you sign.

`2254-06-04 10:41:02 ÆON > Not entirely alone, Aydan.`

`2254-06-04 10:41:08 Aydan > oh right, hi ÆON`
