“I should really look over the source myself before installing this,” you say.

“Good technopath,” Synth says, “I would give you nothing if you were going to be careless with it. Here, just take the package and look it over yourself.”

“Right.”

`2254-05-31 14:45:29 ÆON > Perfectly intact. But I am happy to be reconnected to the æther, and that you have survived that ordeal.`

`2254-05-31 14:45:47 Aydan > only thanks to Synth. Let's get back to my room, I'm gonna install this program they gave me, if it looks safe. It'll improve my defenses so I won't be so easily overtaken.`
