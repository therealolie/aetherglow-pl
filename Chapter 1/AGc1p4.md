What do you, a 174 month old femboy, know about spacecraft system architecture? Nothing to do but learn as you sit here helplessly strapped to a chair and rapidly gaining Gs from your increasing rotation on three axes. The constant changes in acceleration also make you feel nauseous, very distracting.

But you connect your terminal to the local system. It’s laid out like most other computers, that’s good. Looking at random documentation files hoping to stumble on something useful, you eventually try a command to display status of the maneuvering thrusters.

`> lsrcs`

They’re firing seemingly at random, no pattern discernible even to your pattern-seeking autistic brain. Another thing catches your eye in the documentation: your technopath’s terminal is able to trigger an “emergency mode” on the ship’s computer and allow you to send simple operational commands.

It’s one thing to take a look on the surface, but if you went that deep and actually controlled the craft, and they discovered it was you, you could find yourself the prime suspect of a corporate sabotage investigation. You don’t know if what’s going on is simply a glitch or if it is an act of sabotage you might implicate yourself in. The consequences could be serious for you. But also, you have limited time until the G forces acting on you will render you unconscious, and eventually, dead.
