Computers make sense to you, gender does not.  Some days you feel like a boy who’s kind of a girl, but never quite like a boy or a girl.  Most days you feel detached from the two concepts entirely, but you don’t feel your gender is nothing at all.

Regardless, the Academy will offer you any sort of body you want.  It’s not like you can’t change your mind later and try something else, biotechnology has come a long way since the archaic 21st century.
