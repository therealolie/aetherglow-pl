Доброе утро, Лунарианка!

You were born 182 proper Months ago in Korolev City, one of the oldest settlements on Lunar Spaceside.  Your people take pride in surviving the harsh conditions of the Moon, but that doesn’t mean they do it very efficiently.  Those without shelter in the scorching sunlight or the freezing cold of night rarely survive.  Water is life on the Moon, and hard working ice-miners and engineering crews keep the city alive.  Competing chains of hydroponic farms and meat-labs keep the people fed, if they have the SpaceCoin.  The Spaceside Chamber of Commerce ensures a fair economic environment for all Lunatics in its hemisphere.

The culture of Old Russia lives on in Korolev, but only in the commodified form of arts and media, and the Chamber decides which parts of its history are fit for its schools.  Life for a femboy like you isn’t easy, not as harsh as it would be back on Old Earth, but the culture here still offers little support for kids like you.  Few trans people ever hold any true wealth, making social advancement difficult for your people.
