Death is a small risk to take as opposed to being hunted by corporate technopaths forever. You go the extra steps of anonymously entering the shuttle’s emergency command mode. Just in case you are discovered--no plan is foolproof--you even take a few extra seconds to leave logs of each step you take and why you are doing it.

You’re feeling very lightheaded now. You figure you have time to enter a few more commands before you can no longer grip consciousness.

With only numbers on your terminal to go by, you struggle to calculate what you need to do. You are about halfway sure your math is correct under this mental duress.
