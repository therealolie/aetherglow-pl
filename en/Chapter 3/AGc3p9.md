You decide to call on a friend for aid.

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Aydan > Zeta does this message go through??`

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Zeta > why is your timestamp all fucked up` 

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Aydan > yours looks the same, I don't know, nevermind, Zeta I'm in danger, I need help`

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Zeta > what's wrong???`

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Aydan > I'm in the æther and these technopaths abducted me to some far server and there was an exopath living in my head from another time I was dissociated and it looks exactly like me or rather what I want to be and it can see the future but these people have a cult about it or something and call me the vessel and now it's with me and we're somewhere safe probably but I'm afraid to go back to TLA server and I can't wake up yet and if they find me here we're cornered and the exopath is really strong but I'm just Aydan and this is a lot Zeta I'm overwhelmed is this normal in the æther I have no idea what's going on right now`

ÆON touches your avatar head and you feel your anxiety dissolve for a moment.

“Calm.”

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Zeta > so you're in the æther! that's why the system can't discern your local time. um I don't really understand but how can I help? I doubt I could just walk into the medical center and ask for a dissociative shot to come join you`

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Aydan > maybe it's better you're surface-side, come find my body and make sure I'm physically safe, that will be helpful I think` 

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Zeta > got it, where are you?` 

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Aydan > sixth floor lounge in the systemization school building` 

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Zeta > on my way`

“Now I can just wait…” you say. Whatever ÆON did to you, you feel unusually serene for someone in your position, you can think more clearly. “I wish it could just wake me up.”

“If it could access medical tools, Zeta could anesthetize you just as you did to pull K out of the æther in the spacecraft,” ÆON says.

“Good idea. I see you do sometimes have inspiration.”

“It is the logical strategy from the potential outcomes.”

“ÆON, what is the probability that my body is in any danger currently?”

“The surface is beyond my sight.”

You see a new message in your thoughts.

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Zeta > problem` 

`????-??-?? ??:??:?? Zeta > a nurse stopped me from entering, it said I would be interfering with a training session. it was very insistent. now I'm locked out`
