“Their help would be invaluable, we should…in case something happens during the test,” you sign. “But, no, if we did it now and failed, it will only tip off the NULL people that I’m onto them…so, I have no idea what we should do…”

“Unusually indecisive of you Aydan,” Zeta signs.

“I know, we should ask ÆON,” you sign.

2254-07-18 14:41:58 Aydan > ÆON, can you see what would happen if we try to persuade Synth before the exam?

`2254-07-18 14:41:59 ÆON > This decision is now out of your control.`

`2254-07-18 14:42:04 Aydan > what?`

`2254-07-18 14:42:05 ÆON > DANGER ABOVE!`

“Danger above??” you sign to the others as you turn your eyes to the sky.

There’s nothing above you besides the tower you’re leaning against, and the glass barrier far above that, and the Sun beyond it, except for one insect flying over you on wide, flat wings.

“It’s a butterfly,” Zeta signs.

“No it’s not!” Akiko signs, jumping to her feet and reaching up toward it as her eyes flash with light. You and Zeta get up, and instinctively you shield your mind using Synth’s reflective shield. As the bug drifts closer you can see, or feel, what she means--this insect is transmitting an encrypted signal, not something you’re aware of butterflies doing.

“I can’t see what it’s connected to!” Zeta says.

“You two can’t look deep enough into the æther yet,” Akiko signs. “This is a CommSpec task. You two bodyguard me and I’ll trace its network to the source.”

“Got it,” You sign.

She sits down between you and Zeta and closes her eyes, but soon opes them and waves her hands anxiously. “I’m ætherlocked! I can’t dissociate at all,” she signs. “How did I not notice?”

Zeta shouts something to you, but you can’t hear its voice, only white noise. A moment later, your vision turns to static. You try to speak, try to sign, but you can’t feel your body, can’t feel the colony wall pulling you down, can’t feel the warmth of the Sun. You’re lost in a distant featureless void of sensory noise.
