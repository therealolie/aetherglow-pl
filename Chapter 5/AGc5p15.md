`2254-06-04 10:35:39 Aydan > we should try to talk to Synth, without making ourselves vulnerable, but I still think they could be turned to our side`

`2254-06-04 10:35:51 明子 > the impression in the æther when Synth confronted Unas was a feeling of genuine shock and anger, me and Aydan could both see this, I think they're right to assume Synth could be turned against these people`

`2254-06-04 10:35:59 Zeta > I trust you two's judgment on Synth as I've never met them, but still, what are your feelings about this plan ÆON?`

`2254-06-04 10:36:00 ÆON > I can make no assessment of the future without touching the æther, if that was what you hoped to hear.`

`2254-06-04 10:36:06 Zeta > right. then I guess it's as good a plan as any, as long as we're not careless`

`2254-06-04 10:36:13 Aydan > we'll take our time to prepare and take every precaution before we make contact. I'll try and avoid them until then, lay low`

`2254-06-04 10:36:18 Aydan > but also, everyone keep eyes open for any clue about who the vessel of NULL might be, that's the person I definitely want to avoid`

`2254-06-04 10:36:23 Zeta > alright then, that's a plan`

Zeta stands up.

`2254-06-04 10:36:26 Zeta > ÆON club adjourned, see you around`

`2254-06-04 10:36:30 Aydan > wait you don't have to leave, we have all day we can do other stuff`

`2254-06-04 10:36:33 Zeta > that's okay, you two have fun.`

It heads back through the grove of trees.

Akiko takes her hand back to sign to you, “Did it seem upset to you Aydan? It was in such a hurry to leave here.”

“I don’t know, I’m not very good at that sort of thing, reading people and all,” you sign.
