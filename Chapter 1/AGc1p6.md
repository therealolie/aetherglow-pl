You submit your command. After seven seconds, the pressure on your head has lessened considerably. You monitor the status of the ship’s rotation, and it seems you were not the only one working on the problem. The other axes stabilize soon enough and the computer is able to take it from here. This tells you it is likely functioning fine. The thought crosses the back of your mind that signs are pointing to sabotage.

Once stable, the light goes green again and your belts loosen. You unstrap yourself, wanting to move around after all that. You’re finally getting to actually experience microgravity. It’s a strange sensation, as if falling but going nowhere.

Vik also releases himself. “Aydan, what the fuck?”

“Were you looking at it too?” you say.

“Yeah, naturally I at least wanted to see what was killing me.”

“It didn’t look very accidental to me.”

“Me neither. A femboy cyberattack after all?”

“I can’t begin to guess their gender, but a remote attack is all but impossible on an automated shuttle like this. They’re kept on an isolated network and only accept encrypted navigation data. A very close ship could have done it, or, the other and more likely possibility is it was someone on board the shuttle.”
