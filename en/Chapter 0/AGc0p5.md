Born a Lunatic, die a Lunatic, like it or not you are a child of the Moon.  You have lived your life under glass domes and tubes, a labyrinth of interconnected modules built over a period of centuries without much forethought to its design.  You looked up at the stars through the distorted lens of radiation shielding.  Night was brutally cold and day boiling hot.  You cherished the twilight days and knew the harshness of space and sunlight better than anyone.  You have lived your life in 0.16G, making you among the physically weakest humans, but an intensive training program and injections stimulating muscular growth and bone density enhancement will prepare you for the 0.3G environment at Translunar Academy.  TLA will need to know where exactly to arrange your flight from.
