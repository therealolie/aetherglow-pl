In a private military, high ranking officer commissions are often decided before the person is even born.  Such is the contract your parents signed when they joined the board of directors of Redshift Security, in exchange for their firstborn autistic child becoming an asset of the military company.  Most students at Translunar Academy are either private or military contract students, but life isn’t so simple for you.  Your family is funding your education, through a company account, and upon certification as a technopath you will be expected to take a command post in the Redshift military in your family’s name.

You look over your application.  You are a **genderfluid nonbinary femboy** with **every pronoun**.  You are going to transition with the aid of **estrogen**. You come from **Korolev City**, a colony on **Lunar Spaceside** built by Old Russia.  You are becoming a technopath to get away from your family and secure a good job, but your education will be funded by your family, in exchange for your future having been decided before you were born.  All looks good.
