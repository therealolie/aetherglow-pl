poll: Here is a bonus #Aetherglow poll so you can vote on something today anyway: Do you, Aydan of Korolev City, have any artistic interest?
      100%I play an instrument
      0%I like to draw
      0%I am a writer
      0%Programming is an art to me
      0%I have no interest in it

You consider all your autistic knowledge of etymology in making this important decision.  If there is one thing that interests you more than pronouns it is names.  You could choose any you want, but a defiant idea crosses your mind.

**Aydan**.  Similar to what your parents forced upon you, when read in several languages, but in the Turkish language it is a female name, meaning “from the Moon.”  Something to tie you to your homeworld while simultaneously defying your parents’ expectations of you.  Perfect, you will be known as Aydan.

**Character Creation Complete! The story properly begins tomorrow.**
