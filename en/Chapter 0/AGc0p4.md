You like pronouns so much, they are your favorite part of speech.  You couldn't possibly choose just one, or two, or five, you have to have *all* of them. You answer this field by submitting your database file containing every known pronoun in human history--every language, every era.  How to display that on a nametag is someone else‚Äôs problem.

You have completed the gender section and move on to personal history.  In the year 2254, where you come from says a lot about you.

The **space colonies** in orbit at each of the Earth-Moon system‚Äôs LaGrange points house the majority of the human population today.  Most of them were built in the 2100s by enterprising corporations, heavily subsidized by the Earth Protectorate, which later strongly encouraged most Earthlings to move to a better home among the stars.  No government or state exists to oppress colonists.  Instead they are guided by the various Chambers of Commerce, and the invisible hand of the free market.  Colonists tend to be the descendants of oppressed nations and peoples of Old Earth.

The cities on the **Moon** were the first colonies built away from Earth, starting in the late 21st century.  Most were built by spacefaring superpowers of the Old Earth like China, Europe, Japan, and the United States.  But today no Old Earth governments have any presence on the Moon.  The Earthside and Spaceside Chambers of Commerce facilitate a free society on the Moon.  Lunatics tend to be the descendants of the working class of powerful nations of Old Earth.

The **Earth** is the ancestral home of all known life and the cradle of civilization.  Human negligence once threatened all life on this beautiful planet, but the Earth Protectorate changed that when it overthrew the Old Earth and its destructive nations.  The Protectorate is dedicated to protecting and healing the Earth, at any cost.  Today only populations deemed worthy may inhabit Earth, with the exception of just a few large cities maintaining enough industry to accomplish the Protectorate‚Äôs goals.  Earthlings tend to be the descendants of the most privileged people inhabiting Old Earth.
